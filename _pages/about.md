<div style="text-align: justify"> Welcome to my website! My name is Ari Koeppel, and I am a planetary scientist and educator with a passion for studying environmental processes and thermodynamics on Earth and Mars. My scientific interests lie at the interface between sky and ground, where rocks record stories of past climates and the exchanges of life. In my work, I use orbital imagery, develop remote sensing instruments, conduct experiments on Earth, and numerically model thermophysical processes. I currently work as a Postdoctoral Research Associate with Mike Smith at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center using Perseverance Rover data, cold and dry analog data (think Iceland and Antarctica), and modeling to study the modern water cycle on Mars. </div>  <p>&nbsp;</p>

## Outside of science
<div style="text-align: justify"> I love to spend my time playing and teaching outside and making art. My favorite activities include kayaking, rafting, skiing, cycling, climbing, sculpting, ice hockey, and walking my dog Gwynnie (to name a fewâ€¦).</div>
