<div style="text-align: justify;background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);color:Black;padding:15px;border-radius: 10px;"> 	A planetary geoscientist by training, Ari brings a background in research, teaching, and community organizing to his work advocating for space science. He holds a PhD from Northern Arizona University and completed postdoctoral fellowships at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Dartmouth College. Ari has served on the science teams for NASA’s Curiosity and Perseverance rover missions and for the THEMIS instrument aboard the 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter. His research on planetary analogs and permafrost has taken him around the world — from sand dunes in Namibia to glacial waters of the Northwest Passage. Having seen firsthand how exploration and discovery connect people to the natural world and to each other, Ari is eager to advance policies that propel humanity’s ongoing journey in space. 

In addition to science and advocacy, Ari has taught, both formally and informally, at various levels and worked as an experiential educator leading wilderness excursions. Ari's work incorperates creative exploration, both in space and in Earth's wild places, as a tool for cultivating a deeper connection with our natural world. </div>  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;color:White;">Outside of Science</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);color:Black;padding:15px;border-radius: 10px;"> Some of Ari's favorite activities outside of science include outdoor activities like whitewater kayaking, gardening, and walking his dog Gwynnie, as well as creative pursuits like sculpting and ceramics. He also is a regular in pickup hockey at the local ice rink and loves old movies.</div>
