<div style="text-align: justify"> Welcome to my website! My name is Ari Koeppel, and I am a planetary scientist and educator with a passion for studying the processes shape landscapes on Mars, developing remote sensing tools, and inquiring about the coevolution of Earth and life. My scientific interests lie at the interface between sky and ground, where rocks record stories of past climates and surface processes and chemical exchanges drive the cycles of volatiles and life. My work has focused primarily on gaining insights into past and present processes on Mars through analyses of orbital imagery, experiments on Earth, and modeling of thermophysical processes. I currently work as a Postdoctoral Researcher Associate with Mike Smith at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center using Perseverence Rover data, cold and dry analog data (think Iceland and Antarctica), and modeling to study the modern water cycle on Mars. </div>  <p>&nbsp;</p>

## Outside of science
<div style="text-align: justify"> I love to spend my time playing and teaching outside and making art. My favorite activities include kayaking, rafting, skiing, cycling, climbing, sculpting, ice hockey, and walking my dog Gwynnie (to name a fewâ€¦).</div>
