I am planetary scientist and educator with a passion for the climatic histories and landscapes of Mars and the Colorado Plateau. My scientific interests lie at the interface between sky and ground, where rocks record stories of the past and chemical exchange drives the cycles of life. My work has focused primarily on gaining insights into past and present process on Mars through analyses of orbital imagery and weather data. I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher with Christopher Edwards at Northern Arizona University using data from satellites, rovers, and analog studies on Earth, along with models, to uncover how the temperatures of rocks and sediment are affected by their structure and the volatiles they host. 

Outside of science, I love to spend my time playing and teaching outside and making art. My favorite activities include kayaking, rafting, skiing, cycling, climbing, sculpting, ice hockey, and walking my dog Gwynnie (to name a fewâ€¦). In addition to my academic degrees, I also have training as a Wilderness Emergency Medical Technician, in Swiftwater Rescue, Avalanche Awareness, Leave-No-Trace and Search and Rescue.
