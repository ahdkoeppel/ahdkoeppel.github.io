Welcome to my site! I am planetary scientist and educator with a passion for remote sensing tools, the coevolution of Earth and life, and surface processes on Mars. My scientific interests lie at the interface between sky and ground, where rocks record stories of the past and chemical exchanges drive the cycles of volatiles and life. My work has focused primarily on gaining insights into past and present process on Mars through analyses of orbital imagery and meteorological data, experimental calibrations on Earth, and modeling of thermophysical processes. I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher with Christopher Edwards at Northern Arizona University to uncover how the temperatures of rocks and sediment are affected by their structure and the volatiles they host, and what that can tell us about past environments on Mars. 

Outside of science

I love to spend my time playing and teaching outside and making art. My favorite activities include kayaking, rafting, skiing, cycling, climbing, sculpting, ice hockey, and walking my dog Gwynnie (to name a fewâ€¦). In addition to my academic degrees, I also have training as a Wilderness Emergency Medical Technician, in Swiftwater Rescue, Avalanche Awareness, Leave-No-Trace and Search and Rescue.
