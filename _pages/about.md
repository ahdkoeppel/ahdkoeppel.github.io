<div style="text-align: justify;background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);color:Black;"> My name is Ari Koeppel, and I am a planetary scientist and educator working to decipher environmental processes on Earth and Mars that help us better understand the history of and possibilities for life in the universe. My expertise lies in thermodynamic modeling applied to problems in land surface processes, remote sensing, geology, and near-surface atmospheric science. At the interface between sky and ground, rocks record stories of past climates and the exchanges of life; analyzing surface materials is, in a sense, reading that environmental record. I currently work as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center using Perseverance Rover data, cold and dry Mars analog data (think Iceland and Antarctica), and modeling to study permafrost processes and the modern water cycle on Mars. </div>  <p>&nbsp;</p>

## Outside of Science
<div style="text-align: justify;background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);color:Black;"> I enjoy spending time exploring and teaching outside and making art. Some of my favorite activities include whitewater sports, skiing, cycling, climbing mountains, sculpting, ice hockey, and walking my dog Gwynnie.</div>
