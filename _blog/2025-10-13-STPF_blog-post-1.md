Introduction
======
Hello and welcome to the first installment of my monthly blog series,
created to document and reflect on my experiences during a year in
Washington DC as the [inaugural AAAS Advocacy and Policy fellow at The
Planetary Society
(TPS)](https://www.planetary.org/articles/introducing-ari-koeppel-our-first-aaas-science-technology-policy-fellow).
My name is Ari and I am a planetary scientist and educator-turned
science advocate, having worked for the past nine years on remote
sensing projects for both Earth systems science and Mars exploration.
For more details on my background, check out my
[website](https://ahdkoeppel.github.io/). I am grateful to be joining
The Planetary Society at this unique and challenging time for space
science to join the campaign to support US science funding, and I'm
eager to share a little bit about why I'm here.

I have three primary goals for this blog: 1) to serve as a mechanism by
which space enthusiasts, scientists, and policy professionals can learn
about critical topics in space policy in the current political climate,
2) to be a record of the AAAS-TPS Advocacy and Policy Fellowship
experience for future reference, and 3) to provide me with a venue for
routine reflection and growth throughout the fellowship.

I would like for this blog to be both informative and personal; offering
insights on current issues and events in space and science policy, while
also providing a window into what it's like to enter the policy world
after years in academia and research. I will be highlighting a diverse
set of topics in science policy and give anecdotes from the experience
of the fellowship and life in DC. I hope the posts will give readers a
sense for what is actually happing on the ground in DC to promote
science and the specific challenges we're facing. I'm glad you're here,
and I look forward to journeying through the next 11 months with you.

How I Got Here
======
This fellowship has given me an opportunity for the first time to
professionally merge two major interests that have guided me since my
teens: basic science and public policy. For example, I remember being
equally enamored in high school by my IB/AP Physics class and a class
called Politics and Power, which was partly a mock senate. While I
ultimately gravitated toward science in my academics, I became and
remained heavily involved in extracurricular advocacy efforts such as
Jewish Youth for Community Action, the Mosaic Project, and the Berkeley
Teen Task Force while in high school, Dartmouth's Big Green Bus and
Ecoreps while in college, and the Department Equity, Diversity, and
Inclusivity committee and as an officer for the graduate student union
while in graduate school.

Following grad school, I worked as a postdoc at NASA's Goddard
Spaceflight Center, and then back at Dartmouth College, where I also
taught. I quickly found after obtaining my PhD that hyper-focused
technical work and team management left little time for external
obligations. However, when the new administration began threatening
public trust in science and scientific institutions earlier this year --
and then released a devastating President's Budget Request (PBR) in May
-- I knew I could not stand by and ignore my policy and advocacy itch. I
began getting involved with the advocacy efforts of AGU and AAS, two
professional science societies that represent my colleagues and I, and I
published an
[article](https://theconversation.com/a-decade-after-the-release-of-the-martian-and-a-decade-out-from-the-world-it-envisions-a-planetary-scientist-checks-in-on-real-life-mars-exploration-255752)
advocating for Mars research support.

The PBR presented an existential threat to federally-funded research and
the scientific community as we know it. It threatens to cut NASA's
Science Mission Directorate by 47%, NSF's research programs by 58%, and
NOAA's Oceanic and Atmospheric Research by 100%. These cuts would not
just be reductions in resource use or technology development, they would
decimate the already highly competitive primary source of funding for a
community of hundreds of thousands of scientists, engineers, and
educators around the country. They would leave thousands without jobs
and stall a trajectory of American scientific progress for the first
time in over a century. I felt I couldn't stand by and continue doing my
research knowing that my and others' ability to do such work may be cut
off at any moment. Hence, I ran to the fire.

The offer to join The Planetary Society came at the perfect time for me.
I was seeking an outlet to apply my energy and focus to help ensure that
science and discovery continue to thrive in this country. And I
specifically believe in the work of TPS for three key reasons:

1)  I am in awe of the universe and the mysteries that unfold with
    research and exploration. The magnitude of investment required by
    modern space science means it can only really be achieved through
    massive collective effort. With private industry unlikely to pursue
    basic research agendas, only government can ensure these projects
    continue.

2)  I fear for the future of the community of passionate and committed
    scientist-explorers who have devoted their lives to something
    greater than themselves. Fortunately, the House and Senate have
    recognized these pitfalls and largely rejected the cuts proposed by
    the President. However, the scientific community has already been
    taking hits nonetheless with grant freezes, Reductions in Force
    (RIFs) and substantial uncertainty leading to preemptive cuts at
    organizations like NASA. For scientists, it can be prohibitively
    difficult to make progress in long-term projects when job security
    is so uncertain.

3)  Finally, while space and planetary exploration are wildly popular in
    this country, trust in science more broadly is diminishing. TV shows
    like Star Trek, along with the long list of science fiction video
    games, movies, and books, have helped with the popularization of
    space science. Three of the five highest grossing films of all time
    are space-based. Additionally, NASA's announcements of real-world
    discoveries and missions consistently achieve viral status on social
    media, with NASA recording some 197 million followers across its
    platforms in 2022. The American public's love of interplanetary
    travel in media spans major demographics, including political
    ideologies, where [79% of Democrats and 71% of Republicans express
    favorable views of
    NASA](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2023/07/PS_2023.07.20_Space_FINAL.pdf).

    Yet, despite the popularity of space activity, portions of our society
    lack access to or are otherwise detached from the science that has
    enabled space exploration and liberated us from countless maladies. For
    example, there remains a vocal over-skepticism of the validity of
    science in major public safety issues: in 2024, [75% of Americans
    expressed confusion or complete denial over the human-related causes and
    effects of climate
    change](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/12/09/how-americans-view-climate-change-and-policies-to-address-the-issue/#key-findings),
    and [trust in public vaccination programs dropped by 12% between 2019
    and
    2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/05/16/americans-largely-positive-views-of-childhood-vaccines-hold-steady/).
    Without open and digestible access to science, science is at risk of
    becoming undervalued in policy discussions. A challenge I hope to tackle
    is the matter of how we leverage Americans' love of space exploration to
    enhance engagement with all science.

How I Got Here
======

**The AAAS STPF Program and Orientation: A Networking Bonanza**

The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Science
and Technology Policy Fellowship program is a 50 year-old endeavor to
place PhD-level scientists and engineers in non-technical oversight
positions within the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of
the U.S. federal government. In recent history, the program typically
has placed between 140-250 fellows in executive branch agencies each
year. Because of major changes in the structure of federal agencies with
the Trump administration, only \~30 offices have been able to offer
placements for fellows in 2025. With potentially over 200 unplaced
finalists, and a sudden dramatic drop in the number of scientists
entering the federal policy space, AAAS decided to initiate a new
program partnering with non-governmental organizations to place fellows
in science policy-relevant positions outside the government. They've
called this program the "Pathways to Policy Fellowship" (PPF)[^1]. So
far, six PPF/non-governmental placements have been made.

At the start of September of each year, the program runs a two-week
orientation for these fellows, teaching them about the functions, rules
and standards of the federal government and providing an opportunity for
fellows to network. In lecture-style presentations, I learned about the
federal budget-making process and the unprecedented dynamics happening
right now with executive branch reductions and congressional gridlock.
Of course, since orientation, the federal budget has become an even
hotter topic with congress failing to agree on a budget by the September
30^th^ deadline, leading to the 11^th^, and already 4^th^ longest,
government shutdown on record that we find ourselves in now.

</figure>

Still, coming off of a summer of research and fieldwork, the aspect of
orientation that was by far the most unique for me was the networking.
For two weeks, I spent each day getting to know dozens of new colleagues
over lunch and coffee breaks. I also had the opportunity to engage with
other fellows in fun and creative ways: from running mock budget
reconciliation meetings to playing through an AI-focused war game run by
RAND Corporation. It struck me during these interactive activities that
I rarely, if ever, have been in a setting where I am surrounded such an
engaging group of people. This diverse group of PhD recipients from all
around the country and wide-ranging expertise is full of people who are
passionate, hardworking, and exceptionally good at asking questions.
Beyond orientation, I've really enjoyed continuing to build
relationships during weekly well-attended happy hours and get-togethers.

[^1]: A name that I feel wrongly suggests that what I and other PPF
    fellows are doing is on the path to policy, rather than actually
    doing policy work. In fact, when I've described my fellowship to
    others, a frequent response is that it is much more similar to a
    legislative fellowship in how policy-focused it is than a typical
    executive branch fellowship.
