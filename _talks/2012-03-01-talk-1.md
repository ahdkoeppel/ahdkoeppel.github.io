[Every rock has a story to tell, from its composition, shape and even temperature. All these factors help uncover fascinating facts and sometimes unexpected stories from the past. So, what does Mars and its geology and temperature tell us about the big red planet and it's habitability? Come find out!

Infrared cameras aboard satellites in orbit around Mars have collected an astoundingly complete record of martian surface temperatures spanning over five decades. So, how does this help us? Well, the physical makeup of certain rocks and sediments greatly affect how quickly surfaces can heat up or cool down, giving us invaluable insights into the geological make up of areas that are currently inaccessible. Studying these temperatures can make it possible to learn even more about past environmental processes on Mars and even if its climate was once conducive to life. In addition, studying Mars-like field sites here on Earth can help answer even more questions and bring us closer to the ultimate goal of Mars exploration!

In this fascinating lecture come learn about Mars and current NASA-funded work being done at Mars-like field sites on Earth, in Arizona, California, Hawaii and Iceland, in support of temperature interpretation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCP_q8-Ac8I)
